Please give credit if you use this program, and it goes without saying. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION!
THIS IS A FREE APPLICATION CREATED TO HELP COMMANDERS WITH SCANNING OF BIOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGIA'S

But why?
I originally created this application to help me while scanning Biological’s and Geologia's on planets while out in the black exploring. I was getting annoyed with having to constantly jump into the system map and check what I had already scanned, then having to Alt+Tab to notepad to see what I was looking for next on the planet.

My first though was to create a program that could hook into the API or pull the information from the journal files. I quickly concluded that with my skills in coding that I would have no chance, so I started working in VB to see what I could do.

V.8.1 - bug fix

⦁ Fixed spelling mistakes and incorrect picture rotation for Concha


V.8 Release information

⦁ Updated and added more pictures to show the different Species for a specific Genus 

⦁ Tweaked some code to facilitate picture rotation, once you select a Sample

⦁ Added Genus name and estimated values for all Biological samples, and sync'd them with the correct pictures

⦁ Re-positioned the sample display screen, and moved the sample distance notification so that the estimated values for each sample can be displayed

⦁ Added ability to click on sample picture to pause rotation of sample pictures, re-clicking the button of the sample will restart the rotation cycle again

⦁ Renamed all of the picture files (this allows the rotation script to run smoothly)



Previous versions

V.7

⦁ Updated a lot of the code to reduce size - I manged to reduce the code by over 1000 lines (still more work to do) 

⦁ Changed some of the colours to improve text displayed on the Scan buttons 

⦁ Resized and moved the Scan buttons to fix an issue with text alignment


V.6

⦁ Redesigned the whole layout of the application to reduce the width and added menu options (see below for details).

⦁ Relocated the sample screen and sample distance information (screen moved to above instead of below as in v.5).

⦁ Relocated the Reset button so that it's visible when display is off (allowed more room for the menu strip without having to increase the height of the application).

⦁ Changed the background to allow the menu to be added without cropping the Background picture.

⦁ Revamped the background and sample pictures to make it easier in future to update/change them.

⦁ Changed colours of text and buttons, previous colours were too bright. Also updated the code to allow for more variety in colours.

Menu Strip

⦁ Exit		(Ctrl + X - to close the program)

⦁ Display > Off	(Ctrl + D - to remove the display screen and move the Sample Ranges)

⦁ Display > On	(Ctrl + S - to add the display screen and restore Sample Ranges to original position)

⦁ About		(To display this document)


V.5
⦁ Reduced width and changed background picture.

⦁ Updated the sample pictures to add the screen surround (made it easier when moving the display around in the application.

⦁ Added Sample Distance Range information.

⦁ Grouped Biologicals and Geologia's to save some space.

⦁ Updated some code to improve stability when loading images.

⦁ Updated the code so that once the Bio/Geo has been completed you were unable to interact with the scanning button.



V.4

⦁ Increased the width of the application to allow for display screen.

⦁ Added screen to show which Biological/Geological you are actively scanning.

⦁ Redesigned Reset button and relocated to under display screen.



V.3

⦁ Changed background image.

⦁ Removed Biological and Geological Labels.

⦁ Added ability to click on scan buttons to highlight which sample you are currently searching for.

⦁ Added icons for shortcut.

⦁ Renamed the application for better description.

⦁ Repositioned button to tidy up the GUI.


V.2

⦁ Redesigned application completely, V1 was set in a portrait interface and didn't look right to me.

⦁ Removed System and Body entries.

⦁ Changed background image as previous one made the GUI look too busy.


V.1

⦁ Initial Release

⦁ Made a complete mess of code and interface.
